***** Time complaxcity and Space Complexcity *****

Time complaxcity : The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. 

Space Complexcity : The space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of memory it uses as a function of the size of the input.
